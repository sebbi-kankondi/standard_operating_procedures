Open Saturator discharge valve No. 42 (@fig-sat-outlet).\n\n## Repairs\n\nUnder normal circumstances the Dissolved oxygen flotation (DAF) tank acts as an initial filter in the Aquarium system, removing oils, grease and any other suspended solids from the raw sea water intake. This is achieved in conjunction with flocculant from the flocculant column (@fig-biofilter) and micro air bubbles, supplied via nozzles from the saturator column (@fig-sat) that are discharged at the base of a smaller, central DAF column within the main DAF tank. Flocculant coagulates the suspended material, which is then surrounded and lifted by the micro-bubbles, before being skimmed off the top and discharged through the waste outlet.\n\nWhen the DAF performs sub-optimally, unfiltered, raw sea water containing substances such as oils and heavy metals may enter the Aquarium system. This can severely impair the display animals' health, possibly leading to increased mortality rates. Consequently, the DAF systems' performance should not be compromised for prolonged periods.\n\n### Problem diagnosis\n\nExcess bubbling/large bubble formation was identified at the top of the DAF by Mr. Botes after a routine inspection round. Further consultation with Mr. Jan Marais, from Aqua Services and Engineering, narrowed the problem down to a likely issue with the nozzles.\n\n### Tool preparation\n\n**The tools used in @sec-daf-tool were also used here.**\n\n### Nozzle inspection\n\nTo inspect the nozzles, the DAF unit had to be drained of all liquid.\n\n#### Drain DAF\n\n-   **Steps 1-6 will be completed inside the plant room**.\n\n1.

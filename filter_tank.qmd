# Filter tanks

The filtration tanks can be found in the Aquarium's Plant room, located directly underneath the ground floor pseudo bio-filtration system (@fig-ft).

Highly pressurized water from the filter pumps are contained in the filter tanks by a specialized lid at the top of each tank (@fig-filter-pumps). Attached to each lid is a plumbing manifold that consists of a water inlet and the emerged portion of the tanks outlet pipe, with a flow control valve at the inlet labelled "A"; a backwash pipe and valve labelled "B"; a pressure release valve labelled "C" as well as an air inlet pipe with associated valve labelled "D" (@fig-lid).

Inside each filter tank, there are two layers of activated filter media arranged in order of their porosity, with the more porous material stacked near the top (@fig-charcoal).

The filter media, along with a small strainer at the base of the inlet pipe (@fig-lid-strainer), removes fine suspended solids from the sea water circulating in the system. Ultimately improving the overall clarity of the water in the display tanks.

Six cylindrical rosette filters are arranged circularly, via a rosette support fitting, around the base of the immersed portion of the tanks outlet pipe (@fig-filter-plumbing). The rosette filters have several micro-slits lengthwise where water is passed through, into the outlet pipe.

## Maintenance

Filter tank maintenance procedures include a normal backwash, air backwash and the replacement of the filter media, which has to be conducted daily, weekly and decennially, respectively. Frequent backwash procedures are essential to avoid a build-up of trapped suspended solids and the subsequent increase in the filter system pressure, which can be viewed on the manometers placed above each filter bank (@fig-fb-manometer). The filter media has to be replaced prevent it's effectiveness deteriorating over time due the "tunneling" effect of bio-film producing bacteria, allowing unfiltered water to "bypass" the filter media into the main tank (@fig-main-tank).

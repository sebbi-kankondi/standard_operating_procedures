    "text": "Preface\nThis document provides a detailed compilation of the procedures, long and short term, required to keep the National Marine Aquarium at the National Marine Information and Research Center (NATMiRC) operational. Despite the author’s best efforts to generate a stand-alone document, further reading of several technical documents held within the offices of the Aquarium’s technicians is encouraged and indicated where necessary. All standard operating procedures were compiled using a combination of these texts and the technicians’ personal accounts of their work in the Aquarium. Therefore, the sequences for some of the procedures described within this document are not carved in stone but, should still be followed as closely as possible to avoid making serious mistakes.\nTo learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books."

    "text": "2.2 Repairs\nUnder normal circumstances the Dissolved oxygen flotation (DAF) tank acts as an initial filter in the Aquarium system, removing oils, grease and any other suspended solids from the raw sea water intake. This is achieved in conjunction with flocculant from the flocculant column (Figure 2.1) and micro air bubbles, supplied via nozzles from the saturator column (Figure 2.4 (a)) that are discharged at the base of a smaller, central DAF column within the main DAF tank. Flocculant coagulates the suspended material, which is then surrounded and lifted by the micro-bubbles, before being skimmed off the top and discharged through the waste outlet.\nWhen the DAF performs sub-optimally, unfiltered, raw sea water containing substances such as oils and heavy metals may enter the Aquarium system. This can severely impair the display animals’ health, possibly leading to increased mortality rates. Consequently, the DAF systems’ performance should not be compromised for prolonged periods.\n\n2.2.1 Problem diagnosis\nExcess bubbling/large bubble formation was identified at the top of the DAF by Mr. Botes after a routine inspection round.

    "section": "3.2 Repairs",
    "text": "3.2 Repairs\nDuring normal operation the Foam fractionator helps remove excess protein from the recirculated Aquarium water. Air bubbles released from a series of diffusers near the base of the tank, aggregate the suspended protein by exploiting the amphipathicity of protein. This creates a foam that, because of its’ lower density, rises to the Fractionator water surface where it is skimmed off the top. Waste generated through this process is then conveyed to the Fractionator drain valve (Figure 3.1), and discharged along with sludge that may have accumulated at the bottom. The skimmed water settles back into the fractionator. It is then discharged near the Fractionators’ base after passing through four strainers, fastened near the ends of two parallel pipes, which are joined to each other by a central pipe axis (Figure 3.2).\nDecreased Fractionator functionality increases the protein concentration of the Aquarium water, which promotes anaerobic conditions and reduces the waters’ clarity. It is therefore important to ensure the Fractionator is always operating optimally.\n\n3.2.1 Inspect internal plumbing\nTo inspect the internal plumbing, the Fractionator had to be drained of all liquid.\n\nDrain the Fractionator\nSee Section 3.1.2 for a description of the Fractionator draining procedure.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Problem diagnosis\nWhile conducting further maintenance (Section 3.1), Mr. Evelinu noticed that one half of the strainer manifold (Figure 3.2) was misaligned.

This is done to prevent weak fuel flow, essentially optimizing the time required to refuel the Generator tank.\nAtleast two technical Aquarium staff members (one in the Generator room and the other in the Diesel storage room) are required to carry out this procedure\n\nMake sure the Diesel tank’s outlet valve is closed.\n\nClose it if it is open.\n\nPlace a bucket under the Diesel tank’s, fuel outlet line, L-shaped connector found against the wall directly opposite the rooms entrance.\nDisconnect the L-shaped pipe connector.\n\nLoosen the threaded pipe screw with your fingers.\nSome diesel might spill into the bucket.\n\nDisconnect and remove the Generator’s fuel inlet pipe from the fuel tank.\n\nDone to monitor the pipe priming process from the opposite end.\nUse the small screw driver to loosen the pipe clamp.\n\nDrop the disconnected end of the pipe into a bucket.\nFeed the Air cylinder’s delivery line into the horizontal section of the Diesel tank’s disconnected pipe.\n\nInterested in blowing air towards the Generator tank’s disconnected pipe end.\n\n\n\nThe staff members should communicate before executing Steps 7 and 9.\n\n\nOpen the cylinder’s outlet valve.\n\nHold the delivery line in place.\nDiesel will shoot out at the other end of the pipe and into the bucket.\n\nLeave the valve open until only air is discharged at the other end.\nClose the outlet valve.\nRemove the cylinder’s air delivery pipe from the horizontal section of the Diesel tank’s disconnected pipe.\nReconnect the L-shaped pipe connector.\n\n\nContact one of the MFMR fuel suppliers (Section???) to help discard the fuel that has accumulated in the buckets (Steps 12 and 14).\n\n\nPack the bucket where it was found.\nClamp the Generator’s fuel inlet pipe to the fuel tank.\nPack the bucket where it was found.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Refuel procedure\nOne technical Aquarium staff member required to carry out this procedure\n\nNote the Generator’s fuel level (Section???)\n\nIf the fuel level &gt; 40% there is no need to proceed with this procedure.\n\nNote the Diesel storage tanks fuel level (Section???).\n\nIf there is very little or no fuel left, this tank will have to be refueled before refueling the Generator (Section ???).\n\nLoosen the Diesel tank’s filler cap.\n\nFound on the top of the Diesel tank (climb on one of the oil barrels to the right to access it).\nUse the pipe wrench.\nDone to ensure a vacuum is not created when the fuel levels drop in the Diesel tank.\nFuel will stop flowing from the tank if this is not done.\n\nLoosen both of the Generator tank’s filler caps.\n\nFound on top of the Generator’s fuel tank, on it’s front end.\nUse the pipe wrench.\nDone to prevent pressure from building up in the tank, due to increasing fuel and diesel fume amounts.\n\nOpen both the Diesel tanks outlet valves.\n\nFound at the tank’s base, beneath the filler cap.\n\nA bucket and hose pipe should be readily available, incase the fuel overflows.\nLeave the Generator tank to fill up for an hour.\nAfter one hour, return and note the Generator tank’s fuel level (Section???).\n\nThis is used to determine the refuel rate, which will help provide an estimate for the total refuel time until 90% of the Generator’s capacity.\n\nLeave the tank to continue filling up.\nReturn after the estimated total refuel time (Step 22).\n\n90% has been chosen as the refuel limit, leaving the extra 10% as a buffer against potential fuel spillage.\n\nCheck the Generator’s fuel level.\nClose the Diesel tank’s outlet valves once the fuel level has reached 90%.\n\nCan be slightly lower than 90%.\nThis will stop the flow of fuel to the Generator tank.\n\nClose the Diesel tank’s filler cap.\nClose the Generator tank’s filler caps.\nNote the Generator’s fuel level (Section???).\nThe Generator’s fuel level reading will fluctuate for a few days. Do not add more fuel.\nRepack all tools in the correct storage rooms or compartments."

The air bank is maintained to ensure the dive cylinders can still be filled up if the compressor is not working.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: These 50\\(l\\) gas cylinders constitute the air bank from which air is decanted into the dive cylinders.\n\n\nThere are 10 small (10\\(l\\)) and 3 larger (50\\(l\\)) cylinders used for diving and for the air bank, respectively. The dive cylinders are kept close to a mounted wall heater to keep their temperatures from dropping too low and thus, preventing condensation on the tanks outer surface (Figure 7.3).\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: The 10 10\\(l\\) cylinders used for diving, each with their air inlets covered.\n\n\nOnly the Bauer compressor is currently operational.\nFor the sake of convenience, ensure that the majority of the dive cylinders are always filled with air i.e., there should never be more than 2 empty cylinders at a time.\n\nLift the empty dive cylinders and leave them standing up right.\n\nWhen empty, the dive cylinders are left laying horizontally on the ground with their air inlets exposed.\nThe tanks should never be completely depleted (leave them at approximately 20bar before refill).\n\nExamine the Bauer compressor’s oil level.\n\nUse the dipstick found at the top of the compressor (Figure 7.1).\nIf the compressor’s oil level is low, refill with spare Bauer compressor oil found in the cupboard next to the compressor in the Workshop.\n\n\n\nIf there is no oil in stock, more can be obtained from Benguela enterprises (Contact Mr. Roberto).\n\n\nConnect the filler whips (Figure 7.4), from the air bank, to the air inlet of the empty cylinders.\n\nThe valves on the air bank valve rack and 50\\(l\\) air cylinders should be left open when not in use (Figure 7.4).\nSecure the whips to the cylinders by tightening the threaded coupling of the lock valves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Valve rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Manometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Filler whip\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Image of the air bank’s valve rack and corresponding parts.\n\n\n\nClose the pressure release valves on the connected filler whip (Figure 7.4).\n\nTurn clockwise.\n\nOpen the air discharge valve on the filler whips.\nOpen the air inlet valves on the empty cylinders.\n\nTurn anti-clockwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: The compressors’ control switchboard with the compressor log book on top.\n\n\n\nSwitch the Bauer air compressor (Figure 7.1) on and press the “run” button on the compressor switch board (Figure 7.5).\nAllow the cylinders to fill up.\n\nThe compressor will stop filling the cylinders up automatically once they reach 220bar.\nFinal pressure can be read from the manometer directly above the bank valve rack (Figure 7.4).\nFor two cylinders, this will last approximately 25mins.\n\nOnce full, open the pressure release valve on the filler whip.\nDetach the dive cylinders from their respective filler whips.\nClose the air inlet valves of the dive cylinders.\nClose the air inlet valves of the filler whips.\nCover the inlet valves of the cylinders’ with masking tape and leave them standing upright close to the mounted heater next to the other cylinders (Figure 7.3).\n\nThis is done to show that they have recently been filled.\n\nRe-rack the filler whips.\n\n\nFor steps 13 and 14, drain the waste fluids into a small used bottle (Figure 7.6).\n\n\nDrain the used oil from the compressor.\n\nOpen the valve on it’s bottom left side (Figure 7.6).\n\nDecompress the compressor air.\n\nOpen the two decompression valves on it’s bottom right side slowly (Figure 7.6).\n\nClose the decompression valves when done.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: The oil release valves (left, metallic valve) and decompression valves (right, black valves) found at the bottom of the Bauer air compressor, along with an old bottle to collect waste fluid.\n\n\n\nComplete the relevant log sheet and book.\n\nFound on top of the compressor switch board (Figure 7.5).\n\n\nIt is important to let the dive cylinders cool down for at least 6 hours before using them.\nThe rate at which the air cylinders have to be filled (cylinders/month), depends almost entirely on how frequently they are used."

Research vessel (RV) survey teams are only approached to aide in the acquisition of new display animals when the desired animals can not be accessed via the other three avenues e.g., to collect Deep sea red crab. When making use of an RV, the Aquarium technicians either make arrangements with the survey crew leadership to obtain and take care of the animals until the RV docks, or for one of the Aquarium staff members to be sent along with the RV to take care of the animals during transit.\n\n8.4.1 Port access\nA port access card is required for admission into the Namibian harbour at Walvis Bay (Namport).\n\nContact Mr. Bartholomae, to write a letter requesting the issuance of access cards for the relevant Aquarium staff members.\n\nAccess cards are only issued to Aquarium Technicians and TAs\n\nBook the Cruiser and/or Corolla (Section 6.1.1).\nMake a copy of your ID.\n\nDoes not have to be certified.\n\nDrive to the Namport Customer services office, found on the right side, right before the entrance to the Commercial harbour (wet dock).\n\nThe Commercial harbour is North of the Namport head office.\n\nHand all relevant documents in to the official on duty.\n\nCopy of ID and letter from Mr. Bartholomae.\nAn access card will be issued on site after your picture is taken.\n\n\nPort access cards only need to be renewed once a year.\nThese can be obtained as part of an already scheduled visit to Namport to complete an unrelated task but, it is advised that plans to acquire access cards be kept separate from any other activity in case there is a delay at customer services.\n\n\n8.4.2 Sampling procedure\nRegardless of the arrangements made, the Aquarium’s Sample tank and any accompanying tubes have to be provided prior to the RVs departure, to facilitate the collected animals’ care during transit. After the RV’s return from it’s survey trip, the animals have to be collected at Namport and transported back to NATMiRC.\n\nDeploy sample tank\n\nContact the crew leader/(s) to request the extraction of the display animals as part of the survey.\n\nDifferent surveys are allocated different crew leaders according to the study species.\n\nSchedule a date and time to transport and load the large sample tank onto the RV before it departs.\nBook the Cruiser (Section 6.1.1).\nLoad the Sample tank onto the back of the car.\n\nThis will require the help of up to 4 technical Aquarium staff members.\n\nPrepare for travel.\n\nTwo members of the Aquarium’s technical staff should take this trip.\n\nDrive to the Namport dry docks and park next to the docked RV.\n\nThe Dry dock is South of the Namport head office.\nThe port access cards have to be presented at the entrance.\n\nReport to the survey crew leader.\n\ne.g., Eric Maletsky is currently in charge of the crab biomass surveys.\nHe/she will arrange for either a group of people to help carry the tank onto the RV or for one of it’s cranes to help lift it on board.\n\n\n\n\nTank preparation and animal sampling\n\nLoad the large tank onto the RV.\n\n\nSteps 9-11, 14 and 18 ensure the tank has a constant supply of fresh sea water and will be done with the help of the crew leader.\n\n\nConnect a large pipe to the Bilge pump outlet.\nTie a few ball sinkers (.&gt; 500g) along the last 30cm of the pipe’s opposite end, using fishing wire.\n\nDone to keep this end of the pipe submerged once the sample tank has been filled with water.\n\nDrop the weighted end of the pipe into the sample tank.\nThe RV will depart for the survey after all necessary preparations have been made.\nOnce the desired animals are located, they will be caught using one of several fishing techniques generally used by the RVs e.g., swept area trawling, deep sea trawling, traps, etc.\n\nSophisticated acoustics technology is used to locate the animals.\n\nSwitch the Bilge pump on manually at the boat’s helm, before bringing the animals on board the RV.\n\nLeave it running for the duration of the RV’s trip.\n\nPlace the animals in the tank after it has filled up.\nInspect the tank daily.\n\nDone to detect any dead animals or any issues with the fresh sea water circulation system.\n\nRemove any dead animals as soon as they die.\nFix any issues with the water circulation system.\n\nClear the pipe inlet if it is blocked and make sure it is weighted to the bottom of the tank.\n\n\n\nDaily monitoring of the tank (Steps 15-18) can be done by one of the Aquarium’s staff members, if arrangements are made to have one join the survey crew.\nOtherwise, the crew leader can be asked to ensure these tasks are fulfilled.\n\n\nSwitch the Bilge pump off within 1km of the harbour.\n\nWater close to the harbour may be heavily polluted and mixing it with the water in the tank should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\nCollect sample animals\n\nThe skipper or survey crew leader will provide an estimated time of arrival before the RV returns to Namport.\n\nThis information will be given to Mr. Bartholomae or to the CFRT at the Aquarium.\n\nBook the Cruiser for that day ((Section 6.1.1).\nPrepare the required number of the Aquarium’s quarantine tanks before leaving (Section 10.4).\nDrive to the Namport dry docks and park next to the docked RV.\n\nOnly one person should drive to Namport If an Aquarium staff member is returning with the RV\n\nReport to the survey crew leader.\n\nHe/she will arrange for one of the RV’s cranes to help lift the tank off board and for people to help load it onto the back of the Cruiser.\nThe crew leader will also make sure the types and approximate numbers of the different species, being driven out of port, are recorded on the skippers report sheet.\n\nLift the tank off the RV.\n\nIf Deep sea red crabs were sampled, the tank can be drained completely to make moving it easier.\n\nLoad it onto the back of the Cruiser.\nTake a copy of the skippers report sheet or go to the ports exit with RV crew members who have it.\n\nNamport inspectors will have to count and verify the contents of the tank before you are allowed to leave.\n\nReturn the vehicle (Section 6.1.3).\n\n\nClear the path to the quarantine tanks before completing the next Step.\n\n\nDrain the tank halfway.\nCarry the tank into the quarantine section (Chapter 10). • At least 4 members of the Aquarium’s technical staff will be needed for this.\nQuarantine the animals (Section 10.4)\nClean the sample tank.\nReturn all used aquarium equipment to storage."

    "text": "10.2 Quarantine period\nThe period of quarantine is variable and risk-dependent (Arthur et al. 2008). Aquariums usually quarantine for a minimum of 30 days, but often longer depending on the species (Jones 2014). This period includes mandatory routine treatments with copper and/or formalin for parasites and antibiotics for wounds and other diseases (Vaughan 2019).\nA universal treatment applied to the entire main tank is unfeasible, considering the diversity of fish species present and their distinct sensitivities to specific treatments. Moreover, routine quarantine treatment would have to be carried out with consistency, necessitating a highly dependable procurement of medicinal drugs.\nFor these reasons, it is advisable to only quarantine newly acquired marine aquatic species (Chapter 8), or live exhibits displaying initial signs of disease infestation such as anomalous behavior (Section 9.1), in the quarantine tanks for a minimum period of 21 days. This duration encompasses the incubation period for most aquatic diseases and parasites, providing an ample timeframe for potential symptoms to manifest more clearly, ensuring they can be readily detected.
